The efficiency of an ideal heat engine is $50\%$. What will it become if the temperature of the hot reservoir is increased by $50\%$ and the temperature of the cold reservoir is decreased by $50\%$?

Present the answer in LaTex format: \boxed{Your answer}
assistant

[response] To determine the new efficiency of the ideal heat engine after the changes in the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Efficiency Calculation:**
   The efficiency of an ideal heat engine is given by the Carnot efficiency formula:
   \[
   \eta = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}
   \]
   where \( T_h \) is the temperature of the hot reservoir and \( T_c \) is the temperature of the cold reservoir. Given that the initial efficiency is 50%, we can write:
   \[
   0.5 = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}
   \]
   Solving for \( \frac{T_c}{T_h} \):
   \[
   \frac{T_c}{T_h} = 0.5
   \]
   Therefore, \( T_c = 0.5 T_h \).

2. **Temperature Changes:**
   - The temperature of the hot reservoir is increased by 50%, so the new temperature of the hot reservoir \( T_h' \) is:
     \[
     T_h' = T_h + 0.5 T_h = 1.5 T_h
     \]
   - The temperature of the cold reservoir is decreased by 50%, so the new temperature of the cold reservoir \( T_c' \) is:
     \[
     T_c' = T_c - 0.5 T_c = 0.5 T_c = 0.5 \times 0.5 T_h = 0.25 T_h
     \]

3. **New Efficiency Calculation:**
   The new efficiency \( \eta' \) of the heat engine with the updated temperatures is:
   \[
   \eta' = 1 - \frac{T_c'}{T_h'} = 1 - \frac{0.25 T_h}{1.5 T_h} = 1 - \frac{0.25}{1.5} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   \eta' = \frac{5}{6} \times 100\% \approx 83.33\%
   \]

Therefore, the new efficiency of the heat engine is \(\boxed{83.33\%}\).

A circle of radius 5 is inscribed in a rectangle, with the ratio of the length of the rectangle to its width being 2:1. Calculate the area of the rectangle.

Present the answer in LaTex format: \boxed{Your answer}
assistant

[response] To find the area of the rectangle, we need to determine its length and width. Given that a circle of radius 5 is inscribed in the rectangle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the width of the rectangle. The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the width of the rectangle is:

\[ \text{Width} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The ratio of the length to the width of the rectangle is 2:1. Therefore, the length of the rectangle is:

\[ \text{Length} = 2 \times \text{Width} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The area of the rectangle is the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 20 \times 10 = 200 \]

Thus, the area of the rectangle is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]
